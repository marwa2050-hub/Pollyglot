# Pollyglot
Reflection Building PollyGlot helped me practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a clean translation app. The hardest part was matching the design, but I enjoyed adding small improvements like animations and better styling. Overall, it was a fun and useful project that improved my frontend skills.
